# **ECG Atrial Fibrillation Detection**
**Last Modified:** 25/03/2025  
**Project based on the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017**  
**URL:** [PhysioNet Challenge 2017](https://www.physionet.org/challenge/2017/) 



## **Project Description**
This project aims to **detect atrial fibrillation (AF)** from single-lead ECG recordings.  
It was developed as part of the **AI in Healthcare course** by students from **MSc Data Science & Business Analytics (CentraleSup√©lec - ESSEC)**: **Dora VECSERNYES, Jinsuh YOU, and Julien DEHUT**.  

We applied **signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning** techniques to extract ECG features and train a classification model.

## **Key Results**
- The best performance in the original PhysioNet Challenge was **0.83**.
- Our best model achieved an accuracy of **0.81**, which would rank us **9th out of 68** in the challenge.
- The biggest challenge was distinguishing between **Normal (N) and Other (O) classes**, due to **class imbalance** and subtle differences in ECG waveforms.
- Further improvements could include **ensemble models combining Random Forest and CNNs**.

## **Installation & Execution**
### ** Prerequisites**
Install required Python libraries:
bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn pywt tensorflow

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and a GPU (optional for deep learning models).

### ** Running the Notebooks**
1. Clone this repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ECG_AF_Classification.git
cd ECG_AF_Classification

2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
bash
jupyter notebook

3. Open the ECG_Exploration.ipynb to explore the dataset, Don't run it, or run it only if you downloaded the original datasets of the challenge

4. Train models using RF_windowed.ipynb, RF_FFT_Wavelet.ipynb, or CNN_ensemble.ipynb.

---

## **Future Work**
- Validate the model on an independent dataset to confirm generalizability.
- Improve feature engineering (e.g., test additional entropy measures, fractal dimensions).
- Combine Random Forest & CNN models for a more robust classification.
- Optimize hyperparameters using Bayesian Optimization or Genetic Algorithms.
